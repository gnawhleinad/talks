intent

- share my professional journey
- share my learnings as a product manager
- share how GitHub works

---

timeline?

uc berkeley
bigfix ibm
github

---

i made the transition to product management because...

- i love learning and have major fomo
  - product managers work with _everyone_ in the company and spans multiple
    disciplines
- i'm passionate about vision and execution
  - product managers lead their domain / team with strategic vision to
    encourage behavior and address painpoints
- i have role models who happen to be product managers

---

today, i work on the enterprise persona but when i started i worked solely on
github enterprise server

---

tangent and FYI

January 2019
https://github.com/enterprise

GitHub Enterprise

---

the first major functionality that i worked on was pre-receive hooks

(and, it shipped in GitHub Enterprise 2.6.0)

---

https://github.com/github/enterprise2/issues/5977

GitHub operates very transparently and is very good about using written
communication

---

https://github.com/about/diversity

> 67% don't work in headquarters

---

rely on asynchronous communication because:

- mcolyer SF
- willabides Austin, TX
- dbussink Netherlands
- rubiojr Spain
- jordemort Chicago, IL
- mwiesen Germany

it's great because you also have a written record of your decisions and train of
thought so that future decisions can take _that_ into consideration

what's powerful about asynchronous communication is that it allows you to
prioritize what's important and invest time to have an informed input

---

transparency!

FYI, github records feedback in a repository
https://github.com/github/customer-feedback

it allows _anyone_ in the company to share feedback from a customer so that
project leads can use that feedback when advocating or prioritizing features

https://github.com/github/customer-feedback/issues/41

https://github.com/github/enterprise2/issues/5977#issuecomment-155637375

allows you to be cross-discipline

---

with transparency and async workflows, we can have cross-discipline, diverse
culture and thought minded workflows and solutions

---

another example of how the transparency / async workflow manifests into value
for us internally and for you, our customers:

https://github.com/github/business-support/issues/770#issuecomment-232171792

---

one of my favorite learnings as a product manager was from former VP of
product @kakuls and it was something along the lines of:

> product vision isn't owned by product managers
> ...
> the best ideas can come from _anyone_

---

github is in a very fun and fortunate domain where we're a software company
working on a software product for software developers

we're privileged to have incredible talent passionate about solving their
software problems for us and others

---

github's vision is to allow _insert-software-people_ to collaborate with others
not necessarily in the _same way_ that github does but, hopefully, with the same
underlying principles

but we can't do it alone; and it's been dangerous for us to think that our
solution will be _your_ solution.

---

one of the things that github is doing now is practicing what's called _lean
customer development_

https://www.cindyalvarez.com/lean-customer-development/

---

my biggest value and learning is it's structure / process to allow technology
/ product leadership to use more objective evidence to shape our vision and work

---

https://github.com/github/enterprise-product/issues/62

thanks for listening.

and, thanks for your ongoing support. we need it to make the best product.
